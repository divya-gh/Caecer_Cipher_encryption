It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.### Objectives - Provide user with options for encoding or decoding their message -  User must enter a message for encoding or decoding with a shift value - Print encoded message - Print decode  message - Ask user if they would like to continue.## Screenshots- Result : ![Screenshot](./Images/OutPut.jpg)## Technologies* Python 3.8* VB code Editor* Gitbash## Setup1.
